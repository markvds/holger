# Holger Lib

[![StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/53442008/shield)](https://styleci.io/repos/53442008)

This library is a tool to interact with routers that support the TR-064 standard.
It is mainly tested with a Fritz!Box 7360 by AVM.

## Why?
Using SOAP APIs is a real pain. There are a lot of obscure URNs, strange XML description files and a lot of XML responses.
 Although PHP provides a quite good SOAPClient class, it is still nearly impossible to see the intent of the code.

 This library aims to provide a friendly interface to the API.

## Installation

The library can be installed via composer. Run the following command:

```
composer require davidbohn/holger
```

## Usage

Instantiate the Holger\Holger class by passing the host name and, if necessary, a username and password, that can be used to authenticated against the router interface.
Then you can query the different endpoints like this:

```php
<?php

require_once "vendor/autoload.php";

$credentials = [
    'username' => 'user',
    'password' => 'password'
];

if (file_exists('config.php')) {
    $loadedCredentials = include 'config.php';

    $credentials = array_merge($credentials, $loadedCredentials);
}

$holger = new Holger\Holger('192.168.178.1', $credentials['password'], $credentials['username']);

var_dump($holger->ip->externalIP());

var_dump($holger->ip->externalIPv6());
var_dump($holger->ip->getIPv6Prefix());
var_dump($holger->ip->status());

```

## History

### 0.6


### 0.5
New API structure, that uses central Holger class to access all modules. Breaking changes!
Thanks to [sbreiler](https://github.com/sbreiler) for the addition of the WANMonitor module.

### 0.3
Retrieval of answering machine messages from Fritz!Box routers was added.

### 0.2
This release adds some new endpoints and also introduces new features for the phonebook.

### 0.1
Initial version, that is in no way feature complete but shows how stuff could work.
Currently basic reading of the phonebook, info about DECT handsets, resolving of substation ids (given by call monitor).
